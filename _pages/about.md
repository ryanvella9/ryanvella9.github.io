I am a postdoctoral scientist in the [Atmospheric Physics group](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-physics.html) led by Prof. Ulrike Lohmann at ETH Zurich, where I am investigating the role of ice-nucleating particles in mixed-phase clouds using global climate models.

I completed my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Chemistry](https://www.mpic.de/2285/en) and the [Institute for Atmospheric Physics](https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb08-ipa-en/), Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. Under the supervision of Prof. Jos Lelieveld and Prof. Holger Tost, my doctoral research focused on vegetation–climate interactions, specifically the role of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions in the Earth system.

Before my PhD, I completed a fellowship in Earth Observation at the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/) in Frascati, Italy. I hold a BSc in Physics & Mathematics and an MSc in Geosciences from the [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/).

My research sits at the intersection of atmospheric chemistry, climate science, and Earth system modelling, with a strong interest in the processes that shape cloud formation and their role in the climate system.



## Research

My main research interests include:

- Earth System Modelling
- Aerosol-cloud interactions
- Cloud physics
- Aerosol-climate interactions
- Land-biosphere-atmosphere interactions
- Biogenic secondary organic aerosols
- Climate dynamics

  Other research interests:

- Earth Observation
- Satellite remote sensing
- Shipping emissions
- Light pollution


## The Rest

In Malta, I co-founded and managed the environmental NGO Għaqda Siġar Maltin. I am involved in projects aimed at raising awareness about light pollution and the importance of preserving the remaining Dark Sky Heritage Areas (DSHAs) in Malta. I enjoy biking, hiking and taking photographs.
