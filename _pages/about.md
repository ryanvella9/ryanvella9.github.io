I am a postdoctoral scientist at [ETH Zurich](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-physics.html), where I investigate ice-nucleating particles in mixed-phase clouds using global climate models. I completed my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC)](https://www.mpic.de/2285/en) and the [Institute for Atmospheric Physics](https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb08-ipa-en/), Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. Supervised by Prof. Jos Lelieveld and Prof. Holger Tost, my doctoral research focused on vegetation–climate interactions, specifically the role of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions in the Earth system. I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics & Mathematics, followed by a Master of Science degree in Geosciences, both from the [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/). Prior to beginning my PhD in Mainz, I completed a fellowship in Earth Observation at the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/) in Frascati, Italy.
