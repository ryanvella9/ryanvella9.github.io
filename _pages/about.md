**Email:** _ryan.vella@env.ethz.ch_

I am a postdoctoral scientist in the [Atmospheric Physics group](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-physics.html) of Prof. Ulrike Lohmann at ETH Zurich, where I am investigating the role of ice-nucleating particles in mixed-phase clouds using global climate models.

I completed my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Chemistry](https://www.mpic.de/2285/en) and the [Institute for Atmospheric Physics](https://www.blogs.uni-mainz.de/fb08-ipa-en/), Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. Under the supervision of Prof. Jos Lelieveld and Prof. Holger Tost, my doctoral research focused on vegetation–climate interactions, specifically the role of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions in the Earth system.

Before my PhD, I completed a fellowship in Earth Observation at the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/) in Frascati, Italy. I hold a BSc in Physics & Mathematics and an MSc in Geosciences from the [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/).



## Research

My main research interests include:

- Earth System Modelling
- Aerosol-cloud interactions
- Cloud physics
- Aerosol-climate interactions
- Land-biosphere-atmosphere interactions
- Convection

Other research interests:

- Earth Observation
- Satellite remote sensing
- Shipping emissions
- Light pollution


## The Rest

I co-founded and managed the environmental NGO Għaqda Siġar Maltin in Malta, dedicating several years to promoting ecological sustainability. I am passionate about trees, birds, and the natural environment. I enjoy working with satellite data and also operate several personal environmental sensors in Malta. As part of my conservation work, I help to raise awareness about light pollution and advocate for the preservation of Malta’s remaining Dark Sky Heritage Areas. Beyond these projects, I enjoy biking, hiking, and capturing the beauty of nature through photography.
