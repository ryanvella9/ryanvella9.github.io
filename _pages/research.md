## Research Overview

My research sits at the intersection of atmospheric chemistry, climate science, and Earth system modelling, with a strong interest in the processes that shape cloud formation and their role in the climate system.

## Current Research

### Ice-Nucleating Particles in Mixed-Phase Clouds

As a postdoctoral scientist at ETlsH Zurich, I am investigating the role of ice-nucleating particles in mixed-phase clouds using global climate models. This work focuses on understanding how these particles influence cloud microphysics and their broader implications for climate.

## Previous Research

### Vegetation-Climate Interactions

During my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, my research focused on vegetation–climate interactions, specifically examining the role of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions in the Earth system. This work explored how vegetation influences atmospheric chemistry and climate through the emission of these compounds.

### Earth Observation

As a fellow at the European Space Agency (ESA) in Frascati, Italy, I worked on Earth observation projects, gaining valuable experience in remote sensing applications for atmospheric and climate research.

## Research Interests

- **Atmospheric Chemistry**: Understanding chemical processes in the atmosphere and their climate implications
- **Cloud Microphysics**: Investigating the formation and evolution of clouds, particularly mixed-phase clouds
- **Earth System Modelling**: Using numerical models to study interactions between different components of the Earth system
- **Biogenic Emissions**: Studying how vegetation influences atmospheric composition through volatile organic compounds
- **Climate Science**: Examining the role of various atmospheric processes in the climate system

## Research Methods

- Global climate modeling
- Atmospheric chemistry simulations
- Earth system modeling
- Remote sensing and satellite data analysis
- Field measurements and laboratory studies

## Collaborations
