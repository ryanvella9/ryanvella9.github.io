Over the past few years, I’ve been processing satellite images of the Maltese Islands. In this space, I share some of my favourite true-colour images along with other insights extracted from satellite data.

I also operate several sensors across Malta to monitor atmospheric conditions—such as weather, air quality, and night sky brightness—among other environmental parameters.
